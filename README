# Simulation of Intelligent Robot Navigation using IR-SIM

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates intelligent robot navigation in a simulated environment using **IR-SIM (Intelligent Robot Simulator)** integrated with the **RDA (Regularized Dual ADMM) Motion Planner**.  
The simulation focuses on autonomous navigation, collision avoidance, sensor-based perception, and trajectory tracking without the need for physical robot hardware.

The project was developed as part of the **Computer Organization and Architecture (COA)** coursework and draws parallels between robotic control flow and the CPU **fetch–decode–execute** cycle.

## ⚙️ How the System Works

### 1. Environment Initialization
- Environment parameters such as world size, obstacles, robot type, sensors, and goal position are defined using a YAML file.
- IR-SIM loads this configuration automatically.

### 2. Robot Creation
- Robot kinematics, shape, speed limits, and sensors are initialized.
- Supported robot models include Differential Drive and Ackermann Steering.

### 3. Path Loading
- A precomputed reference path is loaded and visualized in the environment.

### 4. Navigation & Control Loop
For each simulation step:
- **Fetch:** Read robot state (position and orientation)  
- **Decode:** RDA-MPC planner computes optimal control  
- **Execute:** Apply velocity and steering commands  
- **Sense:** Detect obstacles using simulated sensors  
- **Avoid:** Update constraints for collision-free motion  
- **Update:** Move robot and refresh visualization  

### 5. Termination
- Simulation ends when the robot reaches the goal or maximum iterations are completed.

## 🧩 Architecture Concept
The navigation pipeline mirrors CPU execution cycles taught in COA:

| COA Cycle | Robot Navigation |
|----------|------------------|
| Fetch | Read robot state |
| Decode | Planner decision |
| Execute | Apply motion |
| Write Back | Update state |
